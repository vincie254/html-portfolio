        <h3>Power Book 2</h3>
        <img src="../assets/images/powerbook2.jpg" alt="powerbook2 image"/>
       <p>This is a continuation of the heated drama pack dubbed "Power". It takes us through to what happens after the death of the arguable plot master in the original series: Ghost. Tariq, the son to Ghost, now runs the show. Its my top recommendation this week. Watch it. </p>
       <h3>Sistas</h3>
       <img src="../assets/images/Sistas.jpg"/>
       <p>This is a drama series by 4 hot women that live by the sister code. It varies from the arguments over men, to unique life choices by the women and what is significantly outlayed; is the support they have for each other. Danny will certainly crack your ribs, especially on the things she does when high. Watch it as well.

    <h3>All American</h3>

       <p> This series is catchy to al the baseball lovers. Its a twist of love, love for the game, love for the ballers, the survival through trafficking of drugs, and more. I recommend. Please watch it as well. </p>
